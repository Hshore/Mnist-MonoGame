# Mnist-MonoGame
A Machine Learning project. This project was to teach myself more about machine learning and neural networks. I decided not to use tensorflow or other machine learning libraries so I would get a better understanding of how the network actually works.

This network is built from scratch and uses supervised learning with gradient descent to identify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

Recently I have changed the computation from CPU to GPU for a massive speedup. I used OpenCL to achieve this.
